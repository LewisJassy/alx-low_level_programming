Usage
To use the singly linked list in your project, follow these general steps:

Initialize a singly linked list.
Perform operations like insertion, deletion, or searching on the list.
Clean up the list when you're done to avoid memory leaks.
Here's a basic example:

[programming
Copy code
#include singly_linked_list.h

int main() {
    // Initialize a singly linked list
    SinglyLinkedList list;
    initialize(&list);

    // Insert elements into the list
    insert(&list, 42);
    insert(&list, 13);
    insert(&list, 7);

    // Print the contents of the list
    print(&list);

    // Perform other operations

    // Clean up the list
    destroy(&list);

    return 0;
}
